            <p>In this video I will cram as much as possible about CSS. We will be looking at styles, selectors,
                declarations, etc. We will build a CSS cheat sheet that you can keep as a resource and we will also
                create a basic website layout.
                We are using CSS3 but mostly the basics.
                I will be creating an advanced CSS course with animations, etc. I do have a Flexbox in 20 minutes video
                as well if you want to learn flexbox.

            <p>After astronaut Rusty Schweickart looked down on Earth from space for the first time, he described a
                sense of awe that has become common to almost every space traveler since: “You realize that on that
                little blue and white thing there is everything that means anything to you, all history and music and
                poetry and art and death and birth and love, all of it on that little spot out there you can cover with
                your thumb.” NASA calls this realization “the overview effect."</p>

                things from a scientist’s point of view, not an astronaut’s, but he reaches the same conclusion: Earth
                is fragile and “before it is too late, we should embark in earnest on the most fundamental existential
